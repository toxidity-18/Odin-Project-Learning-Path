# Working with text 

## Introduction 
- Website content is text based .

## Paragraph 
- Lack of p-tags causes text inside the body tag to be clumped together as one single line .
- To create a paragraph we will need to use the p element tag .

## Heading
- h tag makes the text bolder , larger and thus signify they are headings .
- Levels of h tag include 
    ```html 
     <h1>The most important heading</h1>
     <h2></h2>
     <h3></h3>
     <h4></h4>
     <h5></h5>
     <h6></h6>
     ```
## Strong 
- strong tag makes text bolder and also affect web tools 'screen reader' thus the tone tends to change once it detects presence of a strong tag .

## em 
- em tag emphasis the text thus making it italic 
- NB Semantic tags are mainly used inside or within other text elements .

## Nesting and indentation 
- This is the processing of creating parent and child like relationship between element , thus causing indentation due to nesting .
- Indentation helps to make our content clear and readable
- Parent and child assist in styling with css and interactivity through javascript .

## HTML comment 
- Not visible to the browser : thus used for noting down what our code represent or important pieces of data inside our codes .
